# Flexbox Project

This directory contains the sequence of HTML and CSS files implementing the Holberton School Flexbox project tasks (0 through 14). Each numbered pair (`n-index.html`, `n-styles.css` or `n-article.html`, `n-styles.css`) reflects the state after completing the corresponding task.

**Usage:**
- Open the desired HTML file in a browser to inspect layout and verify flexbox behaviors.
- Styles are incremental; later files build upon earlier changes.

Images referred in the HTML should be placed in the `images/` subdirectory.

All CSS files follow the instructions in the project description and include comments marking sections and task-specific rules.
